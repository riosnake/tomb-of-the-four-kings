# Tomb of the Four Kings
Personal project I'm working on to implement a unique solitaire variant.

As far as i've searched, there seems to be no digital version of the game, and so the goal of this project is to give me practice with python's unittest modules, git workflow,
and create the first digital version of the game, with lofty future goals of wrapping it within a GUI and potentially porting over to mobile.
