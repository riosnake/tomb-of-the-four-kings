Tomb of Four Kings is a fantasy adventure card game for a single player. 
With each turn, you defeat monsters, disarm traps, and open doors as you explore
a dark dungeon. Along the way you collect treasure, gain skills, even use magic.
But death awaits those who linger too long, and if all your torches burn out
you will be lost in the dungeon forever. The objective is to find the tomb hoards of 
four ancient kings, collect as much additional treasure as possible, and make it out alive.
